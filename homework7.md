- Not only for criminals: Tor is widely used by activists, journalists, and families for privacy, not just by criminals.
- No military backdoor: While Tor was originally funded by the U.S. Navy, experts have verified that there is no backdoor in the system..
- Legal to run a relay: No one in the U.S. has been prosecuted for running a Tor relay, although exit relays can attract attention from law enforcement.
- Easy to use: The Tor Browser Bundle is easy to install and use, and tools like Tails provide full internet anonymity.
- Tor speed: Though slower than regular browsing, the Tor network has become faster thanks to ongoing improvements.
- Not foolproof: Anonymity can be compromised if Tor is misused (e.g., logging into personal accounts), so it’s vital to follow best practices and keep software updated.
