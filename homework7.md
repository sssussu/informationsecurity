### Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

- Tor still works: Despite efforts by the NSA, Tor’s encryption hasn’t been fully compromised; most attacks target browser vulnerabilities or user mistakes.
- Not only for criminals: Tor is widely used by activists, journalists, and families for privacy, not just by criminals.
- No military backdoor: While Tor was originally funded by the U.S. Navy, experts have verified that there is no backdoor in the system..
- Legal to run a relay: No one in the U.S. has been prosecuted for running a Tor relay, although exit relays can attract attention from law enforcement.
- Easy to use: The Tor Browser Bundle is easy to install and use, and tools like Tails provide full internet anonymity.
- Tor speed: Though slower than regular browsing, the Tor network has become faster thanks to ongoing improvements.
- Not foolproof: Anonymity can be compromised if Tor is misused (e.g., logging into personal accounts), so it’s vital to follow best practices and keep software updated.


### Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser €; subchapters: "Introduction", "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router", "How The Onion Router Works", "Tracking Criminals Using TOR".

- Introduction: Tor is a commonly used tool that allows users to browse the web and communicate anonymously, helping protect their privacy.
- History and Intended Use of The Onion Router: Originally created by the U.S. Navy to secure communications, Tor is now used by various groups, including activists and journalists, who need anonymity.
- How The Onion Router Works: Tor anonymizes internet traffic by passing it through several encrypted layers, making it hard to trace the user's original connection.
- Tracking Criminals Using TOR: Although Tor hides users' identities, law enforcement can sometimes identify criminals by exploiting browser weaknesses or analyzing traffic patterns.


### a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR. If you got TOR installed in the class, you can write this part from memory. Make not of it if you're writing it from memory and not as you work).

- Use the web browser in Linux to search for Tor ( www.torproject.org) and download it.
