## Threat modeling manifesto
### What is threat modeling? 

Threat modeling is a process used in early stage of planning a system, project or any organization to protect their security from any potential concers and threats.

In threat modeling we analyze, manage and highlight any threats for the security system.

By indentifying threats in early stage we can create a more succesful system that is protected from hackeers or any other kind od security risk.

#### when we threat model, we ask four key questions:

1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good enough job?

This four key questions are vey essential in threat modeling. By answering all of this questions we can build a good security system for a company in example.

#### Why treat model?

- While performing threat modeling we can realise all the things that can go wrong in a system and potentially prevent from any future damages that could come at high price.
- It allows us to indentify design and implementation problems that needs to be fixed whether it is in a early stage or during the entire life of the system.
- The results we get from threat modeling can be used to improve the system.

#### Who should threat model?

Anyone with a individual or larger system who is concerned about the safety and the security of their system.

#### How should I use manidesto?

- You can use it as a guide to improve your own idealodgy about a therat model.
- By following the guidance in manifesto we can result in more effective and succesfull threat modeling.
- Use the ideas that manifesto provides for your own advantage.

###### The values that manifesto shares:
 1. A culture of finding and fixing design issues over checkbox compliance
 2. People and collaboration over processes, methodologies, and tools.
 3. A journey of understanding over security or privacy snapshot.
 4. Doing threat modeling over talking about it.
 5. Continuous refinement over a single delivery.

###### Principles of manifesto:
1. Threat modeling works best when you use it continously.
2. It should fit with how you and your team work and build and keep up with any design changes in small and manageable steps.
3. The results of threat modelignare useful when they matter to the people who are involved.
4. Talking openly helps everyone understand what needs to be done and writing things down keeps track of those agreements and lets you measure progress.
